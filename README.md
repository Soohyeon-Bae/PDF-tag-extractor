# PDF Text Extraction 

This repository provides a framework for extracting text from PDF documents and processing the extracted text with regular expressions to filter out unwanted information.
 
## Overview 
 
The main goal of this project is to extract meaningful text from PDF files using OCR methods and to refine that text using regular expressions. The process includes:

1. **Text Extraction**: Using OCR libraries to extract text from PDF files.
2. **Text Processing**: Applying regular expressions to filter the extracted text, improving precision and recall.

## Installation

To set up the project, clone the repository and install the required packages:
````
git clone https://github.com/Soohyeon-Bae/PDF-Text-Extraction.git
cd PDF-Text-Extraction
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

## Usage

1. Place your PDF files in the `data/input/` directory.
2. Run the text extraction script:
````
python src/pdf_extractor.py
````

3. The extracted text will be saved in the `data/output/` directory.
4. Use the text cleaner script to refine the extracted text:
````
python src/regex_extractor.py
````

## Preprocessing Techniques

To improve the precision and recall of the extracted text, the following preprocessing techniques can be applied:

- **Removing Unwanted Strings**: Use a predefined list of unwanted strings to filter out irrelevant content.
- **Whitespace Removal**: Trim unnecessary whitespace from the extracted text.
